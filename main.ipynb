    "The Wellcome Collection is a vast and culturally diverse set of materials, ranging from medical and ethnographic objects, historical manuscripts, books and journals spanning dozens of cultures and over 50 languages. Its materials range from everyday items to rare documents and artworks, making it a rich resource for understanding health, culture and the human experience across time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet despite the breadth and value of these holdings, many items suffer from missing or incomplete metadata—such as unknown dates, origins or creators—which limits how effectively they can be catalogued, searched or interpreted. Our project aims to address this challenge by developing machine-learning methods to predict or approximate these missing fields using available textual descriptions and, when possible, images. By providing archivists with reliable, data-driven estimates, we seek to help enrich the Wellcome Collection’s records and improve access to its diverse cultural heritage.\n",
